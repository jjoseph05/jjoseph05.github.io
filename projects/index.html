<p>You can see the code I sling at on my <a href="http://www.w3schools.com">Github</a> space. I"m currently Designing and Developing on the front end of things, for a web application called HearUs. Details to come.</p>
<p>In college I started a blog for my <a href="http://justinjoseph1.blogspot.com">art portfolio</a>, I have plans to revisit it as my skills evolve and level up. </p>
<p>At bootcamp I started another blog to record my experiences at DevBootcamp. <a href="http://justinjoseph0.tumblr.com">Simulacrum and Simulation</a> unfortunelty didn't make it past two posts. My less than one year old solid state drive died, and I lost all the posts I had in my Notes program. A good lesson in learning to let go, and to upload my posts in the moment, instead saying I'll do it tomorrow.</p>
