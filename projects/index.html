<p>You can see the code I sling at on my <a href="http://www.w3schools.com">Github</a> space. Currently, I'm working on Design and Development for the front end of a web application that will help people reach out to their representation in congress.</p>


<p> <a href="http://justinjoseph1.blogspot.com">http://anatta-ly.herokuapp.com/</a>, is an item sharing app I build with 2 cohort-mates at DevBootcamp Chicago. The timeframe for building the app from pitch to product demo was 8 days. I had the best time, and it was an amazing way to end such an intense and rewarding experience.</p>
<p>In college I started a blog for my <a href="http://justinjoseph1.blogspot.com">art portfolio</a>, I have plans to revisit it as my skills evolve and level up. </p>
<p>At bootcamp I started another blog to record my experiences at DevBootcamp. <a href="http://justinjoseph0.tumblr.com">Simulacrum and Simulation</a> unfortunelty didn't make it past two posts. My less than one year old solid state drive died, and I lost all the posts I had in my Notes program. A good lesson in learning to let go, and to upload my posts in the moment, instead saying I'll do it tomorrow.</p>
<p>This site's <a href="http://jjoseph05.github.io/blog/">blog</a> is currently empty. A state I plan to remedy. It will be a place to collect my thoughts, help me reflect and grow, and if I'm lucky, I hope it does the same for others.</p>
