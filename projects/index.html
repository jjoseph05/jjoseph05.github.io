<p> <a href="http://anatta-ly.herokuapp.com">Annata-ly</a>, is an item sharing app I build with 2 cohort-mates at DevBootcamp Chicago. The timeframe for building the app from pitch to product demo was 8 days. I had the best time, and it was an amazing way to end such a ridiculously intense and rewarding experience.</p>

<p>You can see other code I've slung on my <a href="https://github.com/jjoseph05">Github</a> space. Currently, I'm working on Design and Development for the front end of a web application that will help people reach out to their representation in congress.</p>

<p>While I was in college, I started a blog for my <a href="http://justinjoseph1.blogspot.com">art portfolio</a>. I have plans to revisit it as my skills evolve and level up. </p>

<p>At bootcamp I started another blog to record my experiences at DevBootcamp. <a href="http://justinjoseph0.tumblr.com">Simulacrum and Simulation</a>, unfortunately didn't make it past two posts. My less than one year old solid state drive died, and I lost all the posts I had saved in my Notes program. A good lesson in remembering to upload my posts in the moment and learing to let go if I ever forget.</p>

<p>This site's <a href="http://jjoseph05.github.io/blog/">blog</a> is currently empty. A state I plan to remedy. It will be a place to collect my thoughts, help me reflect and grow, and if I'm lucky, I hope it does the same for others.</p>
